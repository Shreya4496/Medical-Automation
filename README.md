# Medical-Automation
We have tried to be automate the medical history of every living person in India . From his / her birth an entry in database will be stored for every individual which includes all the medical prescriptions , diagnosis details, vaccines or any other significant detail which can be used in future. Our project will focus on keeping the data on centralized server for every person in India so that it could be referred remotely as and when required . Automated records will not only provide more timely, accessible patient information, but will provide opportunities to link practitioners to knowledge systems, thereby supporting the diagnostic process and quality indicators that generate clinical interventions and reminders. A dynamic, complete patient record consistently maintained across diverse care sites will continue to be an essential component in patient care.
